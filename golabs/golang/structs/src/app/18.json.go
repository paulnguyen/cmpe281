		The inverse operation to marshaling, decoding JSON and populating a Go
		data structure, is called unmarshaling, and it is done by
		json.Unmarshal. The code below unmarshals the JSON movie data into a
		slice of structs whose only field is Title. By defining suitable Go
		data structures in this way, we can select which parts of the JSON
		input to decode and which to discard. When Unmarshal returns, it has
		filled in the slice with the Title information; other names in the
		JSON are ignored.
