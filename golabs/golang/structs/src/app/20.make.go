	https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

	The built-in function make(T, args) serves a purpose different from new(T). It
	creates slices, maps, and channels only, and it returns an initialized (not
	zeroed) value of type T (not *T). The reason for the distinction is that these
	three types represent, under the covers, references to data structures that
	must be initialized before use. A slice, for example, is a three-item
	descriptor containing a pointer to the data (inside an array), the length, and
	the capacity, and until those items are initialized, the slice is nil. For
	slices, maps, and channels, make initializes the internal data structure and
	prepares the value for use.
