/*

The for loop is the only loop statement in Go. It has a number of forms
Parentheses are never used around the three components of a for loop.
The braces are mandatory, however, and the opening brace must be on the
same line as the post statement.

	for initialization; condition; post {
		// zero or more statements
	}

Any of these parts may be omitted.  If there is no initialization and nopost,
the semicolons may also be omitted:

	// A traditional "while" loop
	for condition {
		// ...
	}

If the condition is omitted entirely in any of these forms, for example in

	// a traditional infinite loop
	for {
	    // ...
	}

The loop is infinite, though loops of this form may be terminated in some
other way, like a break or return statement.
