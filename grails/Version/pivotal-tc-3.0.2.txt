Pivotal tc Server Developer Edition
3.0.2.SR2

You have downloaded the tc Server Developer Edition.  This edition of tc Server is made up of the following features:

	* The tc Runtime application server.
	* Supporting utilities for creating and starting tc Runtime instances.
	* Templates for creating specific types of tc Runtime server instances, such as SSL- or cluster-enabled.
	* Spring Insight, an application that provides you with real-time visibility into the behavior and performance of
	  your applications.

How Do I Get Started?
---------------------
To begin using tc Server, a server instance must be created.  This can be done using the tcruntime-instance.sh script on
Unix and tc-runtime.bat on Windows.  First, identify and create an "instance directory" for your instances. Then, for Unix based OSes,
the following can be run to setup a basic instance that is capable of handling both HTTP and HTTPS:

	* tcruntime-instance.sh create --template bio --template bio-ssl --instance-directory <instance-directory> example-instance

This will create a directory in the specified instance directory called example-instance. Not specifying the --instance-directory 
property will create the instance in the current working directory, this is not recommended. The README.txt in that
directory will explain specific details about the instance.  To start this instance, use tcruntime-ctl.sh

	* tcruntime-ctl.sh -n <instance-directory> example-instance start

Once the instance has started, the instance will be available at http://localhost:8080 or https://localhost:8443.

There is also a createInstance script in the "quickstart" directory that will walk you through the process of creating a new instance as shown above.

tc Server has many other templates available to customize the instance creation process.
See the "Getting Started with tc Server" Guide for conceptual information about tc Server and its different editions
(including this Developer Edition), as well as installation and usage instructions.
