Aophelper is an attempt to make it easier for people to start using aop.
It will set up all the different jars and its possible to select different settings.

Aophelper has two modes. One compile mode and one run mode; 
The compile mode will only try to aopcompile already compiled javacode.
Run mode will try to run a aopcompiled program. It can also run it with loadtime weaving 
(which means that no aopcompile step is necessary.

Note that Aophelper is still in a early beta stage, please report any issues/ideas to the
aop dev team either to our forum or mailling list.
